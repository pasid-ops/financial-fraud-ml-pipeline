>> Credit Card Fraud Detection using Federated Learning

This project implements a privacy-preserving credit card fraud detection system using Federated Learning (FedAvg). The model is trained across multiple clients without sharing raw transaction data, making it suitable for sensitive financial applications.
A Logistic Regression model is used, with a focus on handling highly imbalanced data and evaluating performance using standard classification metrics.

>> Key Highlights
1. Federated Learning with Federated Averaging (FedAvg)
2. Imbalanced data handling
3. Distributed client-side training 
4. Model evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score

>> Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
