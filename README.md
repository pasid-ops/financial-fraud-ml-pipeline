Credit Card Fraud Detection using Federated Learning

This project implements a privacy-preserving credit card fraud detection system using Federated Learning (FedAvg). The model is trained across multiple clients without sharing raw transaction data, making it suitable for sensitive financial applications.

A Logistic Regression model is used, with a focus on handling highly imbalanced data and evaluating performance using standard classification metrics.
